<!--- Borrowing the layout of the Numpy quickstart to get started. -->

## Introduction
<!--- What is ND4J and why is it important. From the nd4j repo readme.  -->
ND4J is a scientific computing library for the JVM. It is meant to be used in production environments rather than as a research tool, which means routines are designed to run fast with minimum RAM requirements. The main features are:
* A versatile n-dimensional array object.
* Linear algebra and signal processing functions.
* Multiplatform functionality including GPUs.

## Prerequisites
<!--- // Java, Maven, git. Coding skills and hello world example. -->
To follow the examples in this quick start you will need to know some Java. You will also need to install the following software on your computer:
<!--- from the dl4j quickstart, pointing to the dl4j quiclstart for details. -->
* [Java (developer version)](./deeplearning4j-quickstart#Java) 1.7 or later (Only 64-Bit versions supported)
* [Apache Maven](./deeplearning4j-quickstart#Maven) (automated build and dependency manager)
<!--- git allows us to start with a cleaner project than mvn create. -->
* [Git](./deeplearning4j-quickstart#Git)(distributed version control system)
