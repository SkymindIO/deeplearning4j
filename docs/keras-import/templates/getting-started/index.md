# Getting started with Keras model import

Below is a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/embed/bI1aR1Tj2DM) demonstrating 
working code to load a Keras model into Deeplearning4j and validating the working network. 
Instructor Tom Hanlon provides an overview of a simple classifier over Iris data built 
in Keras with a Theano backend, and exported and loaded into Deeplearning4j:
