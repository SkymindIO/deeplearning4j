### 0.7.1 -> 0.7.2 Transition Notes

- Activation functions (built-in): now specified using Activation enumeration, not String (String-based configuration has been deprecated)


# <a name="zerosevenone">Release Notes for Version 0.7.1</a>
* RBM and AutoEncoder key fixes: 
    - Ensured visual bias updated and applied during pretraining. 
    - RBM HiddenUnit is the activation function for this layer; thus, established derivative calculations for backprop according to respective HiddenUnit.
* RNG performance issues fixed for CUDA backend
* OpenBLAS issues fixed for macOS, powerpc, linux.
* DataVec is back to Java 7 now.
* Multiple minor bugs fixed for ND4J/DL4J

# <a name="zerosevenzero">Release Notes for Version 0.7.0</a>

* UI overhaul: new training UI has considerably more information, supports persistence (saving info and loading later), Japanese/Korean/Russian support. Replaced Dropwizard with Play framework. [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/userInterface)
* Import of models configured and trained using [Keras](http://keras.io)
    - Imports both _Keras_ model [configurations](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/ModelConfiguration.java) and [stored weights](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/Model.java#L59)
    - Supported models: [Sequential](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/ModelConfiguration.java#L41) models
    - Supported [layers](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-modelimport/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/modelimport/keras/LayerConfiguration.java#L85): _Dense, Dropout, Activation, Convolution2D, MaxPooling2D, LSTM_
* Added ‘Same’ padding more for CNNs (ConvolutionMode network configuration option) [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/ConvolutionMode.java)
* Weighted loss functions: Loss functions now support a per-output weight array (row vector)
* ROC and AUC added for binary classifiers [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/eval/ROC.java)
* Improved error messages on invalid configuration or data; improved validation on both
* Added metadata functionality: track source of data (file, line number, etc) from data import to evaluation. Loading a subset of examples/data from this metadata is now supported. [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/blob/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/dataExamples/CSVExampleEvaluationMetaData.java)
* Removed Jackson as core dependency (shaded); users can now use any version of Jackson without issue
* Added LossLayer: version of OutputLayer that only applies loss function (unlike OutputLayer: it has no weights/biases)
* Functionality required to build triplet embedding model (L2 vertex, LossLayer, Stack/Unstack vertices etc)
* Reduced DL4J and ND4J ‘cold start’ initialization/start-up time
* Pretrain default changed to false and backprop default changed to true. No longer needed to set these when setting up a network configuration unless defaults need to be changed.
* Added TrainingListener interface (extends IterationListener). Provides access to more information/state as network training occurs [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/optimize/api/TrainingListener.java)
* Numerous bug fixes across DL4J and ND4J
* Performance improvements for nd4j-native & nd4j-cuda backends
* Standalone Word2Vec/ParagraphVectors overhaul:
    - Performance improvements
    - ParaVec inference available for both PV-DM & PV-DBOW
    - Parallel tokenization support was added, to address computation-heavy tokenizers.
* Native RNG introduced for better reproducibility within multi-threaded execution environment.
* Additional RNG calls added: Nd4j.choice(), and BernoulliDistribution op.
* Off-gpu storage introduced, to keep large things, like Word2Vec model in host memory. Available via WordVectorSerializer.loadStaticModel()
* Two new options for performance tuning on nd4j-native backend: setTADThreshold(int) & setElementThreshold(int)

### 0.6.0 -> 0.7.0 Transition Notes
Notable changes for upgrading codebases based on 0.6.0 to 0.7.0:

* UI: new UI package name is deeplearning4j-ui_2.10 or deeplearning4j-ui_2.11 (previously: deeplearning4j-ui). Scala version suffix is necessary due to Play framework (written in Scala) being used now.
* Histogram and Flow iteration listeners deprecated. They are still functional, but using new UI is recommended [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/userInterface)
* DataVec ImageRecordReader: labels are now sorted alphabetically by default before assigning an integer class index to each - previously (0.6.0 and earlier) they were according to file iteration order. Use .setLabels(List<String>) to manually specify the order if required.
* CNNs: configuration validation is now less strict. With new ConvolutionMode option, 0.6.0 was equivalent to ‘Strict’ mode, but new default is ‘Truncate’
    - See ConvolutionMode javadoc for more details: [Link](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j/blob/master/deeplearning4j-nn/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/nn/conf/ConvolutionMode.java)
* Xavier weight initialization change for CNNs and LSTMs: Xavier now aligns better with original Glorot paper and other libraries. Xavier weight init. equivalent to 0.6.0 is available as XAVIER_LEGACY
* DataVec: Custom RecordReader and SequenceRecordReader classes require additional methods, for the new metadata functionality. Refer to existing record reader implementations for how to implement these methods.
* Word2Vec/ParagraphVectors: 
    - Few new builder methods:
        - allowParallelTokenization(boolean)
        - useHierarchicSoftmax(boolean)
    - Behaviour change: batchSize: now batch size is ALSO used as threshold to execute number of computational batches for sg/cbow
