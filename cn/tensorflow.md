# TensorFlow's Java API

The TensorFlow web site acknowledges that "The TensorFlow Java API is not covered by the TensorFlow API stability guarantees."

For more information on using Java for deep learning, please see our [Quickstart page](https://deeplearning4j.org/quickstart). Join us in the fight [against the Borg](https://vimeo.com/84760450)! ;)

Deeplearning4j is faster than TensorFlow on [multi-GPUs](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-benchmark). You can read about how to run your own [optimized DL4J benchmarks here](https://deeplearning4j.org/benchmark).

Deeplearning4j can import neural net models trained with Keras 1.0 on TensorFlow to run inference.
