# Deeplearning4j Roadmap

These priorities have been set by what the Skymind has seen demand for among clients and open-source community members. Contributors are welcome to add features whose priority they deem to be higher. 

High priority:

* Parameter server
* Sparse support for ND4J
* Automatic differentiation
* Python support/interface

Medium priority:

* OpenCL for ND4J
* CTC RNN (for speech etc.)

Nice to have:

* Proper complex number support for ND4J (+optimizations)
* Support for ensembles
* Generative adversarial models

Low priority:

* Hessian free optimization
* Other RNN types: multi-dimensional; attention models, Neural Turing Machine, etc.
* 3D CNNs

This is a work in progress. Last updated May 5, 2017.
