# Machine Learning Server in Production 

Deeplearning4j serves machine-learning models for inference in production using the free community edition of SKIL, the [Skymind Intelligence Layer CE](https://skymind.ai/products). 

A model server serves the parametric machine-learning models that makes decisions about data. It is used for the inference stage of a machine-learning workflow, after data pipelines and model training. A model server is the tool that allows data science research to be deployed in a real-world production environment.

What a Web server is to the Internet, [a model server is to AI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1psNOQ3ZpPFeak2zsjO5EgUS-ypoFeyw-3eiLNvyEZzg/edit?usp=sharing). Where a Web server receives an HTTP request and returns data about a Web site, a model server receives data, and returns a decision or prediction about that data: e.g. sent an image, a model server might return a label for that image, identifying faces or animals in photographs.

The SKIL machine learning model server is able to import models from Python frameworks such as Tensorflow, Keras, Theano and CNTK, overcoming a major barrier in deploying machine learning models to production environments.

Production-grade model servers have a few important features. They should be:

* Secure. They may process sensitive data. 
* Scalable. That data traffic may surge, and predictions should be made with low latency.
* Stable and debuggable. SKIL is based on the enterprise-hardened JVM.
* Certified. Deeplearning4j works with CDH and HDP.
