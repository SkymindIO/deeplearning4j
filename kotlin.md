# Using Deeplearning4j With Kotlin

This page is a WIP, but it's easy to [call Java from Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html). 

A few examples of using [Kotlin with Deeplearning4j and Gradle](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-examples/tree/master/dl4j-examples/src/main/kotlin/org/deeplearning4j/examples/feedforward/mnist) can be found here.
