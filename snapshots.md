## <a name="Introduction">Overview/Introduction</a>

**Please use Maven to build 0.9.1, or compile from source.**

We provide automated daily builds of our repositories: ND4J/DataVec/DeepLearning4j/RL4J etc. So, all newest functionality & bug fixes are delivered daily.

Snapshots work like any other maven depenedencies, just served from custom repository, instead of Maven Central.

Note that due to ongoing development, snapshots should be considered less stable than releases: breaking changes or bugs can in principle be introduced at any point during the course of normal development. Typically, releases (not snapshots) shouldbe used when possible, unless a bug fix or new feature is required.

## <a name="Setup_Instructions">Setup Instructions</a>

Basically to use snapshots in your project, you should just add snapshot repository information to your `pom.xml`, like shown below:

```
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>snapshots-repo</id>
        <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
        <releases>
            <enabled>false</enabled>
        </releases>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>daily</updatePolicy>  <!-- Optional, update daily -->
        </snapshots>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

And specify snapshot version. We follow simple rule. If latest stable release version is `A.B.C`, snapshot version will be `A.B.(C+1)-SNAPSHOT`. i.e. as of writing this, latest stable version is `0.9.1`, and snapshot version is `0.9.2-SNAPSHOT`

## <a name="Limitations">Limitations</a>

Primary limitation when using snapshots, is absence of `-platform` artifacts. So, if you've been using `nd4j-native-platform` as your backend, you should be using `nd4j-native` with snapshots.

## <a name="ND4J_Backend">ND4J_Backend</a>

If your pom.xml has a dependency for `nd4j-native-platform` and you switch to using snapshots to get access to a recent feature you will have to switch your `nd4j-backend` to `nd4j-native`

## <a name="Note_to_gradle_users">Note to gradle users</a>

Snapshots will not work with gradle. You will have to use maven to download the files. After that you may try using your local maven repository with mavenLocal().

A bare minimum file like

```Gradle
version '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
 
apply plugin: 'java'
 
sourceCompatibility = 1.8
 
repositories {
    maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
    mavenCentral()
}
 
dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.deeplearning4j', name: 'deeplearning4j-core', version: '0.9.2-SNAPSHOT'
    compile group: 'org.deeplearning4j', name: 'deeplearning4j-modelimport', version: '0.9.2-SNAPSHOT'
//  also tried:
//  compile group: 'org.nd4j', name: 'nd4j-native', version: '0.9.2-SNAPSHOT'
    compile "org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT"
    compile "org.nd4j:nd4j-native:0.9.2-SNAPSHOT:macosx-x86_64"
    testCompile group: 'junit', name: 'junit', version: '4.12'
 
}
```

should work but does not. This is due to [a bug in gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/2882)


Gradle with snapshots *and* maven classifiers appears to be a problem.
